# Project Introduction

Dear GOLDEN OWL,

My name is Nguyen Hoang Phuc, a 4th-year student at the University of Information Technology - VNUHCM UIT. I am pleased to present my result for the web developer intern assignment. I have built a weather forecast website with a responsive design (tablet and mobile). 
* The website uses services from the API provider https://www.weatherapi.com (for weather forecasts) and from  https://openweathermap.org (for obtaining the current location).
* Use the deployment providers https://vercel.com for the client and https://dashboard.render.com for the server.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React, Redux Toolkit, Bootstrap
- **Backend**: NodeJS, ExpressJS
- **Database**: MongoDB

# Features of the Website
- **Search**: View weather forecasts at the search location
- **Use Current Location**: Get current location information and allow searching for the weather forecast 
- **Search History**: See the positions searched today
- **Daily Weather Alerts**: Subscribe and unsubscribe to receive daily weather update emails (verify with token)
